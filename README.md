# Lunar Lander

This is a lander game which has been done before but this is a new take on it. I'm trying to provide a bit more realistice simulation, so there will be a small instrument panel with a AGC DSKY (Apollo Guidence Computer Discplay and Keyboard)

Three phases of the NASA Apollo mission Landing are implemented:
1) Braking - AGC program 63
2) Approach - AGC program 64
3) Terminal Descent - AGC program 66
